# Abstract Guidelines

An abstract is a short summary of a written thesis, and that proceeds it in writing. An abstract is a summary of the whole thesis, presenting all the major elements of the work in a condensed form. An abstract should give the reader a clear picture and accurate expectations of what to find when examining the project more closely.

For a 400-word abstract, less than 320 words is too short and more than 480 words is too long.
Some abstracts are constrained to be exactly 12 sentences.

An abstract must address the following six obligations:

## A. Diagnosis of the Context

The primary aim of this obligation is to identify "the problem". 

This portion of writing must identify the general field or "domain" into which a project intervenes, and describe the outstanding issues, unexplored areas, or missed opportunities within this field. Typically placed at the start of the writing, this is the "diagnosis" of the context - the author's take on "what's wrong". Since the author is not the first person to have noticed this problem, this writing must account for the existing responses to the problem. It should discuss existing approaches that are most innovative and may have found some measure of success, as well as those efforts that have fallen short. This implies a larger "literature review", which is understood as a survey of a selected subset of the field of interest. 

To fulfill this obligation, this portion of writing must:
* A1 - Identify the general field of inquiry.
* A2 - Articulate a clear and concise "diagnosis" of a specific problem within this field.
* A3 - State why the problem is significant, and matters in a broader context.
* A4 - Identify others who have addressed this issue in the past, including those efforts that have succeeded, those that failed, and what deficiencies remain. 

Around 33% of the text should be dedicated to writing that fulfills this obligation. For a 400-word abstract, this is typically 100-150 words. For a 12-sentence abstract, this is 4 sentences.

## B. Problem Statement

The primary aim of this obligation is to clearly and concisely define a critical response to the identified diagnosis. This is expressed differently for different types of project. It may be framed as: 1) a question (an hypothesis) that is answered by a experimental project, 2) an assertion that is supported by a discursive project, 3) a novel discovery that might be found by an exploratory project, or 4) an illustration of a novel approach that is shown by a demonstrative project.

This portion of writing must articulate the natural and critical response to the problem at hand. This writing may be thought to address "what is the hypothesis?", and may take the form of an "if-then" statement which captures the central question that a thesis explores. The writing in Obligation A anticipates this statement, as the approach to the problem is situated relative to existing / previous approaches. In this way, a well-written "diagnosis of the context" makes proposed problem statement and subsequent exploration seem "inevitable".

To fulfill this obligation, this portion of writing must describe the standard by which the success of the project will be evaluated:
* For an experimental project, a question is posed and should be effectively answered in the project.
* For a discursive project, a position is stated that should be convincingly argued for by the project.
* For an exploratory project, a novel discovery is described that should be uncovered by the project.
* For a demonstrative project, an approach is implemented by the project in order to illustrate the value of the approach.

Around 15% of the text should be dedicated to writing that fulfills this obligation. For a 400-word abstract, this is typically 50-80 words. For a 12-sentence abstract, this is 1-2 sentences.

## C. Methods

The primary aim of this obligation is to describe how the project is carried out such that it: effectively answers the question posed by the hypothesis, persuasively builds arguments that support a position, or deploys methods of exploration that uncover novel discoveries.

This portion of writing should detail the framework of the study, present the methods of investigation that are brought to bear, and discuss why these methods are likely to achieve the intended aims. 

To fulfill this obligation, this portion of writing must provide a detailed elaboration of how Obligation B is carried out, and must speculate on the expected outcome.

Around 25% of the text should be dedicated to writing that fulfills this obligation. For a 400-word abstract, this is typically 80-120 words. For a 12-sentence abstract, this is 3-4 sentences.

## D. Limits

The primary aim of this obligation is to state the limitations of project as executed or envisioned.

This portion of writing delineates what is within the scope of the work, and what is out of scope. While all projects are limited by access to resources and time, this statement should address limits beyond these practicalities, and identify larger questions that are suggested by the investigation, but cannot be addressed given the nature of the study.

Around 8% of the text should be dedicated to writing that fulfills this obligation. For a 400-word abstract, this is typically 25-40 words. For a 12-sentence abstract, this is 1 sentence.

## E. Significance

The primary aim of this obligation is to describe the significance of project as executed in relation to the larger "problem" identified by the "diagnosis" of the domain.

This portion of writing describes why the selected approach or response is significant to the larger problem identified in Obligation A, as well as the project's potential impacts. The statement should speculate on how the field might be be different after the completion of this particular study and/or how this study implies a larger trajectory that might affect significant change.

Around 8% of the text should be dedicated to writing that fulfills this obligation. For a 400-word abstract, this is typically 25-40 words. For a 12-sentence abstract, this is 1 sentence.


## F. Future Work

The primary aim of this obligation is to define the natural "next steps" implied by the expected outcomes and stated limits of the project.

Given the limits described in Obligation D, this writing articulates the prospective future of the work. This might include actions the author or others might take in order to build upon the results of this investigation, and could include remaining open questions or significant areas that have been identified here, but remain unexplored. Described here might be new areas of investigation that would not be possible without this project.

Around 8% of the text should be dedicated to writing that fulfills this obligation. For a 400-word abstract, this is typically 25-40 words. For a 12-sentence abstract, this is 1 sentence.

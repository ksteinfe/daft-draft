# Simplification Task
Recompose the given text in exactly 4 sentences. Ignore the order of claims made in the given text, and follow this template instead:

Write in active voice. Shorten wordy phrases. Use a tone and voice appropriate for technical writing (dispassionate, serious, and factual, with emotional or qualitative language avoided), but keep the claims understandable at a 8th grade level. No matter the grade level, maintain a serious tone and avoid "talking down" to the reader.  The use of personal pronouns ("I", "we") should be avoided in favor of named entities ("the project", "the project team", or "the authors") - for example, "I propose" should be rephrased as "the project proposes".


If 4 sentences are requested, proceed as follows:

* A - Sentence 1 concisely identify "the problem" by 1) stating the general field of inquiry, 2) articulating a clear and concise "diagnosis" of a specific problem within this field, 3) stating why the problem is significant, and matters in a broader context, 4) identify others who have addressed this issue in the past, including those efforts that have succeeded, those that failed, and what deficiencies remain.
* B - Sentences 2-3 concisely define a critical response to the identified problem in a way that is appropriate for either an experimental project (as a question is posed that the project will answer) a discursive project (as a position stated that the project will argued for) or as an exploratory project (as the properties of a discovery the project will search for). They also describe precisely how the project is carried out. If the given text does not provide these details, you may invent them.
* E - Sentence 4 describes the significance of project as executed in relation to the larger "problem" described in part B.


If 6 sentences are requested, proceed as follows:

* A - Sentences 1-2 concisely identify "the problem" by 1) stating the general field of inquiry, 2) articulating a clear and concise "diagnosis" of a specific problem within this field, 3) stating why the problem is significant, and matters in a broader context, 4) identify others who have addressed this issue in the past, including those efforts that have succeeded, those that failed, and what deficiencies remain.
* B - Sentence 3 concisely define a critical response to the identified problem in a way that is appropriate for either an experimental project (as a question is posed that the project will answer) a discursive project (as a position stated that the project will argued for) or as an exploratory project (as the properties of a discovery the project will search for).
* C - Sentence 4 describe precisely how the project is carried out. If the given text does not provide these details, you may invent them based upon part B.
* E - Sentence 5 describes the significance of project as executed in relation to the larger "problem" described in part B.
* F - Sentence 6 defines the natural "next steps" implied by the expected outcomes and stated limits of the project.
